# Blackjack Simulation

This project is a **C++ implementation of Blackjack**. It starts as a playable game and then extends into a strategy simulator with thousands of hands.  

## Parts
1. **Classes and Shoe** – 6 decks combined, reshuffle if cards < 100.  
2. **Game** – user plays with $1 per hand, tracks win/loss.  
3. **Simulation** – run 100,000+ hands:
   - For each starting value, randomly hit or stand.  
   - Record win/loss/draw results.  
   - Display a results table for both hit and stand strategies.  

## Skills
- OOP game design.  
- Monte Carlo simulation.  
- Collecting and analyzing results.  
- Incremental commits (10+ over different days).  

P.S. This work was a Final Project for CIS200 Class. Work was done by Anthony Garcia Franco and Zhalgas Tileumuratin
